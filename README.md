#Hello person that is reading this, here is my Neighborhood-map-project!  

##It's still kind of a work in progress, I wanted to add more functionality, i'll come back to it, but it is the requirements to move on from this project.

###Direction's to use.

* Go to http://toklok.github.io and start interacting with my simple app, demonstrating [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), and [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com)

I also added functionality for a mobile application.

This project was created to go with JavaScript Design Patterns from Udacity, it covers all the requirments for this course.

This project was fun and a lot of work for someone who had to read A LOT of documentation, Google Maps was an API I had to learn and Wikimedia's geo-search API, along with Knockout.JS documentation.   

I can't tell you how many times I changed the code around, at first I used more regular JavaScript than KO.JS, KO.JS was great with it's utilities and had great documentation, putting the pieces together at first was daunting, but finally it came around and I understood everything, a great moment.

The links I used to help me to a final product.

* Implement the search bar functionality, check.

* Implement a list view of the identified locations, check (this is when the pins come into focus)

* Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked, check(wikimedia geosearch)
